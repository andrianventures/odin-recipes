    <h2>Recipe Description</h2>
    <p>Cream of mushroom soup is delectably rich and velvety, and my cozy homemade version features both shiitake and crimini mushrooms, plus a hint of sherry, cream, and fresh thyme!</p>
    <p>And nothing compares to homemade cream of mushroom soup, of course, because not only is it prepared with fresh, natural ingredients, but also with lots of love and nurture which makes each spoonful taste extra special and luxurious. You definitely can't get all that out of a can! </p>
